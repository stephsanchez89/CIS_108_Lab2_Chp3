/*  Find the circle
Measure from one side to the other side with a line going straight through
The measurement from one side to the other is the diameter.
Then measure from the diameter line to the edge of the circle.
The line from the diameter to the edge of the circle is the radius.
The circumfrence of the circle is the length of the line of the circle.
pie = 3.1416
To solve for the radius of the circle.r = c / 2pie */
